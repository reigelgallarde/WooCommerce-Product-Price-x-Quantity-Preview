# WooCommerce Product Price x Quantity Preview
An extension to WooCommerce that will preview price total when quantity changes on the product page.

# HOW IT WORKS
The plugin, once activated, do not need to be setup. You will see the total price working on the product page if you change the quantity (works only for simple product type).

This plugin uses WooCommerce currency options settings, so you donâ€™t have to worry about how the price is displayed.

* How to change "Product Total" to my text of choice?

You can paste this code to your current theme's functions.php:

````
add_filter( 'ppqp_price_html', 'ppqp_price_html' );
function ppqp_price_html( $ppqp_price_html ) {
	return str_replace( 'Product Total', 'Order Total', $ppqp_price_html );
}
````
This is an example that will change "Product Total" to "Order Total".
